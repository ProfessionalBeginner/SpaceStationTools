# SpaceStationTools

This repository has been made for the NSS space competition and does not serve a significant purpose without the context of the contest. Please ignore this repo if you have not found it within the context of the competition.

Many of the graphs, calculations, and analyses from the report used Python code to allow for a more realistic and appropriate representation of information. The code used for these elements is hosted in this repo.
